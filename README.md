PhoneGap-webOS-kitchen-sink-app
===============================

The kitchen sink app contains examples on how to call every PhoneGap-webOS API.

Copy the contents of the framework folder and place them into the lib/webos/framework in the PhoneGap distribution.

Be sure to update the following line in the index.html file to use the correct version of PhoneGap:

<script type="text/javascript" src="cordova-1.8.0.js"></script>

Run the make file from the PhoneGap distribution to build & deploy the kitchen sink app.
